In this context, we are happy to introduce Volunteer, which is only an aid to charitable organizations to find simple solutions to create a society for who wants to volunteer in a smooth and simple way through the use of special platforms that allow everyone who wishes to volunteer to be aware of all the activities of charitable institutions in Egypt and the world.

First, let's take a look at what a community can usually gain from volunteering.
• In general, volunteerism enriches our community, brings us together as a community, and helps keep businesses and other organizations afloat.

• Volunteer plays a crucial role in enabling individuals to promote effective citizenship and to build inclusive and flexible societies in which everyone can thrive.

• An interactive interface can be accessed to interact with the organization, the user can access the Volunteer from his mobile phone or from the web application via the conversation and the Volunteer will respond to what he wants and connect to the desired institution.

• Summarize all conferences and charity events for each institution and each user follows them will know everything related to them

• Recommend people with a good rating to go to, or recommend it to the nearest user

• It should be noted that volunteer will do all of these through it's enterprise assistant through data submissions and subscription to Pena Platforms.
